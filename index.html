                <p>
                Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December
                1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer,
                chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed
                mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She
                was the first to recognise that the machine had applications
                beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm
                intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is
                often regarded as the first computer programmer.

              meant Charles Babbage. She was fascinated by Babbage's ideas for a
              machine that could calculate numbers and presumably write letters.
              Ada was 17 when she meant Charles Babbage.
